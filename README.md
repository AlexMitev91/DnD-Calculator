# D&D Dice Roller

This D&D Dice Roller is a simple Python script that allows you to simulate rolling dice based on Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) rules. It calculates the number of natural 1s, natural 20s, and the average score of rolls with advantage, disadvantage, and normal rolls.
The idea was inspired by an argument during a game, on whether rolling physical dice produces different results compared to using a computer-based random function. This script seeks to provide insights into this debate by conducting a comparative analysis.
Although nobody has the time to roll thousands of dices and compare results, you can verify that there is a significat difference when using a peudo random algoritm after rolling 50 dices or so, as the results from this script are more flattened out in comparrison to the physical dice rolls.

# Usage
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository or download the dnd_dice_roller.py file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing dnd_dice_roller.py.
4. Run the script by executing the following command:
```
python dnd_dice_roller.py
```
Follow the on-screen instructions to input the number of rolls.
The script will display the results, including the number of natural 1s, natural 20s, and the average score for advantage, disadvantage, and normal rolls.
